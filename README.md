Overview of the statistical analysis:

W. Avy is an investor who is interested in investing in Hawaii Ice cream shops. I ran many different reports to show him that this business was a profitable one. He asked me to share with him reports that showed the difference of temperatures between June (peak of summer) and December (peak of winter).


Results:

Below is the temperatures chart for June and December.

There are some differences that we found between June and December in Hawaii. 
1.	There are more days that came into the equation. In our total database, there was 1700 days we calculate in the month of June and 1517 days in the month of December. 
2.	The mean in temperature for the month of June is 74.94 and in December is 71.04 which is only 3 degrees. 
3.	The Standard Deviations (std) was 3.25 for June and 3.74 for December. There was not much difference there. 

  

Summary 

As we can see based on our data, Hawaii is a state whose weather does not change much between June and December, making it a great place to have an ice cream and surf business.
Two additional queries that I would include would be the sales of ice cream during these months which will show the demand, and a query that measures the waves. Its very important that there are plenty of high surfing season since this would be a surf and shake shop. These two queries will help investors will have all information needed to make their final decision.
